🌿 My Plant Reminder App

🏆 Unlock mini achievements as you stay consistent

🌱 Why I Made This
This app was created to make simple self-care (and plant care) feel more magical and interactive. Inspired by soft designs, cozy energy, and the joy of tiny progress 🌸

Open the app and add it to your home screen (it works offline too!)

Tap the water button when you "water" your plant

Watch your plants smile… or sulk 😢

Keep the streak going and earn rewards!
